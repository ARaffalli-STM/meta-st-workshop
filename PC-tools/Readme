To use STM32CubeMonitor on a UBUNTU PC to view the magentic field intensity, please follow the below steps:
- Plug the IKS01A3 MEMS expension board to your STM32MPU-DKx board
- Compile the appropriate image and program the flash
- Boot the board and connect it to the host PC via ST-Link port
- Open a console attached to the serial link offered by ST-Link and execute the following commmand:
while true; do ./read_sensor.sh mag | tail -n 1 | sed -e 's/Magnetometer value: \[ //'  | sed -e 's/\]//' | sed -e 's/ //g'; sleep 0.2; done
- The output should be as below,  if it is ok, close the console application
- Open STM32CubeMonitor on the UBUNTU PC and import magnetometer_gauge.json 
- Press "DEPLOY", then press "DASHBOARD"
